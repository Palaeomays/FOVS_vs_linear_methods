# Matlab code for simulations --- Quick Start Guide

Get Matlab ready:
* Download the Matlab files to your working directory.
* Make a \SimData\ subdirectory in your working directory.
* Note that Matlab must have the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox installed (which is required to perform the t-tests).
   + If you run the code without this Toolbox installed, then you will receive an error. There should be a link in the error message that will install the Toolbox for you (depending on your Matlab distribution and licence).

To generate the data for:
* Tables S4--S14 and Fig S1 use the file BigFossilSimsV3.m, by typing
```
	>> BigFossilSimsV3
```
  on the Matlab command line and hit Enter.
* Fig 3 use the file SimStatsChecker.m by typing
```
	>> SimStatsChecker(30000,1000,700,15,100000,1)
```
   on the Matlab command line and hit Enter.
* Fig 8 use the file PrecWRTWorkV3.m by typing
```
	>> PrecWRTWorkV3
```
   on the Matlab command line and hit Enter.

Note that some of these files will take many hours (even days) to run. If you wish to run shorter versions, change the "its" parameter (i.e., iterations) to a smaller number. You can generate new simulations with different parameters using the more detailed instructions contained in "Supporting information file 2".
